## 1. Simple Linear Regression
This project demonstrates how to implement a Simple Linear Regression model using Python and the scikit-learn library. The goal is to predict salaries based on years of experience.

### Steps
- Importing Libraries
- Reading the Dataset
- Splitting the Dataset
- Training the Model
- Making Predictions
- Visualizing Results

 ### Key Learnings
- How to preprocess and split a dataset for machine learning.
- Understanding and applying Simple Linear Regression.
- Visualizing regression results using scatter plots and line graphs.
- Using scikit-learn for training and prediction.
- Importance of train/test split for model validation.

### Sample Output
The regression line fits a linear trend showing how salary increases with experience. The model generalizes well with clear predictions on test data.

## 2. Multiple Linear Regression
This notebook implements Multiple Linear Regression using the sklearn library. It demonstrates:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training
- Predictions
- Performance evaluation using common regression metrics
### Key Learnings:
- Pandas & NumPy are essential for handling structured data.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn are used for data visualization.
- scikit-learn provides out-of-the-box tools for model building and evaluation.
- Pairplot visualizes relationships between numeric features.
- Heatmap shows feature correlation. Helps in selecting impactful variables for regression.
- Coefficients tell how much the target variable changes with a unit change in the feature.
- Intercept is the predicted value when all features are zero.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of absolute errors.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Punishes large errors more.
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Same unit as target; easy to interpret.

  
- Multiple Linear Regression is a good baseline for regression problems.
- Always check multicollinearity and feature importance before deploying the model.
- Preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation are key in real-world applications.
